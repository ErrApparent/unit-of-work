# Motivation

Improvise microservice(s) architecture layer by introducing Unit of Work design pattern in-order to solve common problem related to handling database transactions

# About

- Problem- Irregularity of Handling database transaction in Service Layer via ORM (like- TypeORM, Sequelize, etc)
- Solution - Using Design Pattern : Unit Of Work (Group one or many operation/work into Single Transaction as unit)
- Library Responsibility -
  - Handles Database transaction operations like- create connections, commit, rollback, release connection, etc

# Philosophy

This library has been developed with main goals and provide benefits:

- Loose Coupling between Service/Repositry Layer and ORM Library.
- Layered Architecture.
- Uniformity of Code Guaranteed.
- Error Handling taken care.
- Plug-and-play (just import).
- Solves Concurrency Problem.
- Structures your database transactions flow.
- Removes Code-smell i.e- Managing database transaction in Service Layer.
- Allow Typescript/JavaScript developers to write code that adheres to the SOLID principles.
- Provide a state of the art development experience.
- Facilitate and encourage the adherence to the best OOP practices.

# Description

- Unit of Work pattern is used to group one or more operations (usually database operations) into a single transaction or ‚Äúunit of work‚Äù, so that all operations either pass or fail as one.
- for example of we want to save/POST data in sequential order but transactions fail in while saving the data in some table then - Q) How we will handle this transaction ? (Instead of re-writting code -> Create a design pattern/ Helper functions which can be used by other feature modules while performing db transactions )
- NOTE: Managing database transactions in your service layer and tight copuling with ORM tool is clearly a code smell.

# Installation

You can get the latest release and the type definitions using npm:

```
$ npm install unit-of-work --save
```

# Basic Usage

Let us first see how typically we write code to save a object

```ts
import { getCustomRepository, getConnection } from 'typeorm'; // ‚ùå Anti-pattern
//i,e- Handling database transaction in Service Layer thus tightly coupled
// b/w Service Layer and TyperORM library (Code-smell)
@Injectable()
export class CountriesService {
  async createCountry(country: Countries): Promise<string> {
    const connection = getConnection(); // ‚ùå Manually handling Connections, queryRunner, commits, rollbacks (should have good-knowldge)
    const queryRunner = connection.createQueryRunner();

    await queryRunner.connect();
    await queryRunner.startTransaction();
    try {
      // ‚ùå Irregularity in Error Handling
      await queryRunner.manager.getRepository(Countries).save(country);
      await queryRunner.commitTransaction();
    } catch (err) {
      await queryRunner.rollbackTransaction();
    } finally {
      // ‚ùå Unstructured & Uncertainty in flow
      await queryRunner.release();
    }
    return;
  }
}
```

Now using unit-of-work utility I would urge to follow

```ts
import { TransactionFactory } from 'unit-of-work'; // ‚úÖ  Design-Pattern <= Using UoW (loosely coupled)
@Injectable()
export class CountriesService {
  constructor(private transactionFactory: TransactionFactory) {}

  async createCountry(country: Countries): Promise<string> {
    const transaction = this.transactionFactory.registerORM('typeorm'); // ‚úÖ Register your ORM Vendor

    await transaction.start(); // ‚úÖ Start unit of work

    const work = () => {
      // ‚úÖ Mention all your work - under this function
      const countriesRepository = transaction.registerRepository(Countries);
      countriesRepository.save(country);
    };

    transaction.complete(work); // ‚úÖ Complete your work üòâ
    return;
  }
}
```

Don't forget to provide **TransactionFactory** in providers array of you Module file

```ts
import { TransactionFactory } from 'unit-of-work';
@Module({
  providers: [TransactionFactory],
})
export class CountriesModule {}
```

Let us look into another example of handling ton üèãüèº amount of work together

```ts
import { TransactionFactory } from 'unit-of-work';
@Injectable()
export class CountriesService {
  constructor(private transactionFactory: TransactionFactory) {}

  async createBulkCountries(countries: Countries[]): Promise<string> {
    const transaction = this.transactionFactory.registerORM('typeorm');

    await transaction.start();

    const work = () => {
      const countriesRepository = transaction.registerRepository(Countries);
      for (const country of countries) {
        countriesRepository.save(country); // Saving list of countries object
      }
    };

    transaction.complete(work);
    return;
  }
}
```

# Golden Rules üåü

To Sum-up : This Library provide 3 Golden ü•á Methods i.e-

```ts
// 1. Register your ORM Vendor
const transaction = this.transactionFactory.registerORM('<vendor_name>'); // typeorm or sequelize

// 2. Start your transaction
await transaction.start();

// 3.1 Mention all your work here
const work = () => {
  // logic
};

// 3.2 Complete your transaction
await transaction.complete(work);
```
